Here's an outline for creating a Landslide Detection System using Arduino and commonly available components, focusing on detecting ground vibrations as a potential landslide indicator.

Since you currently donâ€™t have a vibration sensor, you could also consider using an accelerometer sensor (such as the ADXL335 or MPU6050) to detect abnormal ground motion.

Components Needed
Arduino Uno
Accelerometer sensor (e.g., MPU6050) for vibration detection
Buzzer for alerting
LED (Red) for visual alert
Battery to power the system
Working Principle
The accelerometer continuously monitors ground vibrations. When sudden, intense vibrations exceed a certain threshold, the system interprets this as a landslide warning and activates the buzzer and LED.
